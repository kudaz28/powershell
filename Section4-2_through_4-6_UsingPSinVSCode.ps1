# Notice how some DOS commands work in PowerShell Core on Linux/macOS
dir
cls

# But how? Aren't PowerShell commands supposed to be Verb-Noun? 
# The answer is command aliasing
# The alias dir points to the cmdlet Get-Childitem
Get-Alias dir

# We can see all of the aliases for a cmdlet
Get-Alias -Definition Get-ChildItem

# Another alias for Get-ChildItem was gci
gci

# There are lots of aliases
Get-Alias

# Note: Aliases are fine for command line use or quick prototypes
# For clarity however it is a best practice to use the full cmdlet
# name in all scripts you write.
